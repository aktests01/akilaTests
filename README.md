How did you decide on the structure and framework of your solution?
Since we were accessing one main page with all the links I added all the Page objects in the-Internet-Page.js
Also since there were only 5-10 tests that i was going to add did them mostly as part of 1 test. But just added one page as a seperate test file


Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Currently all the Tests are in one Spec file. I might want to have those seperated to seperate spec files.  I added most validations to the Page Object Verifications. Also could have added some validations to the Test itself.

What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
I would have tried to add more Configurations and Reporting related features


What did you think of this challenge?
It was a really interesting challenge. To me Playwright as a tool was new. Did Google following the links provided in the Test Automation PDF. it was a very good learning experience.
